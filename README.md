## ðŸš§ Roadmap

Planned improvements for upcoming versions:

- Extract meta information: `<title>`, `<meta description>`, `<meta keywords>`, favicon.
- Heading structure map (H1â€“H3, optionally deeper).
- Full link inventory: internal vs external references.
- Broken link checker for `<a href>` and `<img src>`.
- SSL/TLS certificate inspection (validity & expiration date).
- Redirect chain tracking and loop detection.
- Selector-only screenshots (e.g. `#main-content`).
- Mobile & tablet viewport emulation (device profiles).
- Security headers report: CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.
- Cookie security flags check (`Secure`, `HttpOnly`, `SameSite`).
- Resource size reporting (large JS/CSS/images flagged).
- CSV/JSON export for structured analysis results.
- Single-file HTML report (with embedded screenshot & results).
- Batch scanning multiple domains from a TXT file.
- Parallel/concurrent scanning for faster batch runs.
- Colored terminal output for better readability.
